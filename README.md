## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using a few simple budgeting methods that are well known within the personal finance community, I built this calculator to make allocating monthly income
quick and simple. I used a conditional to determine which method was selected and which results should be displayed. The allocation calculation is determined by functions related to each percentage amount.
